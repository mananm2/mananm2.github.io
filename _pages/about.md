I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering](https://mechse.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). I am a Research Assistant at [Automation and Digital Manufacturing Lab](http://shaolab.illinois.edu) where I work with [Prof. Chenhui Shao](https://mechse.illinois.edu/people/profile/chshao).    

### Research

My research interests lie ar the intersection of machine learning, applied statistics, and smart manufacturing. More to follow.
